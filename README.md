# AutoML-Classification-Experiments
Experimentation on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques 

# provides practical implementations of automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques on real-world datasets. It includes:

-Customer churn prediction with AutoML on tabular data

-Binary classification for heart disease detection using AutoGluon

Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end workflows for automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, showcasing the advantages of AutoML in both tabular and image data scenarios.
